MealMaker is a mobile-focused web application designed as the main ordering page for a restaurant. Customers must select exactly one main dish, one drink and one dessert before submitting their order. After that, a WhatsApp message is automatically generated, allowing users to send their order with a single tap.

**üí° WHAT I LEARNED**

Working on this project significantly improved my front-end development skills. Throughout the project, I developed and strengthened the following abilities:
- Built functional web features using Vanilla JavaScript, without relying on frameworks
- Gained confidence using DOM properties, methods and traversal techniques to navigate and manipulate elements
- Applied proper use of event listeners, dynamically handling user interactions
- Applied proper use of iteration methods such as 'for' and 'forEach'
- Wrote reusable code by refactoring repeated logic into a single dynamic function
- Understood and applied conditional rendering and class toggling for real-time UI feedback
- Git and GitHub workflows, including resolving merge conflicts and writing meaningful commits
- Simulated real-world order submission by integrating with WhatsAppWeb through URL-based actions
- Improved CSS structuring and styling skills
- Wrote clear documentation and improved project communication through a structured README
